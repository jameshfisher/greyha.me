  <h1 class="articleTitle">The Thatcher effect in typography</h1>

  <p class="hyphenate">
  Near my home, on my dog-walking route, there's a small business called <q>FDM.</q>
  Their initials are emblazoned in 2000pt capitals on the side of the property.
  I don't know what it stands for, or what they do.
  The reason I bring them up is a one screamingly disrespectful disregard for typography,
    in what is an otherwise entirely sober Roman-esque sign.
  </p>

  <p class="hyphenate">
  I'm going to first show it to you upside down, in a fictional billboard advertisement sponsored by the lovely Jayma Mays:

		<figure><div class="sidebar"><figcaption>
 					<p class="hyphenate">Delicious.</p>
			</figcaption></div><img class="widthFull" src="static/thatcher-effect/flipped.png"></img></figure>
  </p>

  <p class="hyphenate">
  Lovely—both of them sexy and sophisticated;
    both with subtle, clean curves that demand attention precisely due to their understatedness;
    both enticing you, by just giving a little away, to look further.
  </p>

  <p class="hyphenate">Right?</p>

  <p class="hyphenate">
  Yes, until the potential customer stops sitting in the driver's seat upside-down,
    or reverts from their hand-walking on the pavement:

		<figure><div class="sidebar"><figcaption>
 					<p class="hyphenate">WTF?</p>
			</figcaption></div><img class="widthFull" src="static/thatcher-effect/right-side-up.png"></img></figure>
  </p>

  <p class="hyphenate">
  WTF?!  Or should I say, MTF?
  The <q>M</q> has suddenly broken in two and fallen in on itself.
  Why was it considered a good idea to use an upside-down <q>W</q>
    in place of the <q>M</q>
    into which the artist had poured countless hours of labour
    in order to be completely unobtrusive?
  Is it intended as 'attention-grabbing'?
  It works; but not all publicity is good publicity—I'm going to have to find myself a new dog-walking route.

    p.s. I'm sorry, Jayma.
    Every stroke of the GIMP brush was like a dagger in your baby-soft skin.
    But it was in the name of Typography!
